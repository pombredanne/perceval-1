# Releases

## Perceval 0.2 - (2016-07-20)

** New features and improvements: **

 * New set of backends added:
    - Bugzilla (REST API)
    - Confluence
    - Discourse
    - Gmane
    - Jenkins
    - Kitsune (Mozilla)
    - Mediawiki
    - Pipermail
    - ReMo (Mozilla)
    - Supybot
    - Telegram
 * The origin of the fetched data is configurable.
 * Unit tests for GitHub, Jira and Stack Exchange were added. Other tests
   were added and improved. Now, the unit tests framework covers a 83% of
   the source code.


** Backend improvements: **

 * **gerrit**
   - support server version 2.8
 * **git**
   - filtering by branches
   - so far, the full log was read before parsing it; now, it is parsed and processed
     while is being read
 * **github**
   - full control of GitHub API rate limit
   - the program can be sent to sleep until the rate limit is reset again
 * **mbox**
   - fetches messages since a given date
 * **pipermail**
   - fetches messages from a *mod_mbox* interface (i.e: Apache)


** Bugs fixed: **

 * Dates that included parentheses sections were not parsed:
   `2005 15:20:32 -0100 (GMT+1)`.
 * An encoding error was raised when `version.py` module was imported. (#32)
 * The call in chain of functions `utcnow()` and `timestamp()` from the
   module `time`, produced wrong timezones on the GitHub backend.
 * Action IRC messages (leading with a single `*`) were ignored. (#48)
 * The `backoff` field received in a Stack Exchange API response was
   ignored. When this field is set, any client must wait the number of
   seconds specified on it before sending any new request.
 * The query used in Gerrit to retrieve the reviews was badly formed when
   the blacklist filter contained two or more reviews. (#50)


## Perceval 0.1 - (2016-03-30)

** New features and improvements: **

 * Supports Python 3.4 and newer versions.
 * Fetches and caches information from several software repositories:
    - Bugzilla
    - Gerrit
    - Git
    - GitHub
    - Jira
    - MBox
    - Stack Exchange
 * Metadata fields are added to fetched items.
 * Dates and times used to request data are always converted to UTC.
 * Unit testing framework is available. Currently, these
   unit tests cover the 62% of the source code.


** Bugs fixed: **

 * Some Git commit log entries may not contain information about files.
   Before this was fixed, Perceval raised an exception with a "_Unexpected
   end of log stream_" message. (#8)
 * Empty Git commit logs raised erros when were parsed. (#17)
 * Character ^M) produced some parsing errors in the Git backend. (#21)
